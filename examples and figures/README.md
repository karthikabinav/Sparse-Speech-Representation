In this folder, we give an example output of the GROUP LASSO algorithm.
1) in.wav: This contains the original sound file. We add white Gaussian noise to
this file to run our experiments
2) noisy.wav: This is the in.wav file with white Gaussian noise added to it. 
This was given as the input to the Group LASSO algorithm
3)out.wav: This is the output of the Group LASSO algorithm after denoising.


The figure combined .png shows the waveforms for all three files.:
